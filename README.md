# ArraysPlus

Advanced blocks for working with numeric and text arrays (number[] and string[]) on the MakeCode micro:bit.

How to use:
1. Open https://makecode.microbit.org
2. Click Settings (gear) → Extensions → paste one of the following into the dialog:
   - github:looking4funn300/funkcije-i-metode
   - or the full URL: https://github.com/looking4funn300/funkcije-i-metode
3. After importing, a category named "ArraysPlus" will appear in the Toolbox with the available blocks.

Example usage in the Blocks editor:
- Create a variable of type Array (Number).
- Use ArraysPlus blocks: push, pop, get/set element, sort, shuffle, sum, average, unique, etc.

Notes:
- This extension currently provides blocks for number[] arrays. If you want string[] (text arrays) blocks added as well, tell me and I will add them.
